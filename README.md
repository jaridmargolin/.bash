# _bash

Handy bash shell aliases and functions that I've written/collected over the years.

# To Install

Clone/Download the repo to your desired location. Navigate to directory and run `_install`. The source code for `_install` is very simple. Take a look if you would like to see what is happening behind the scenes.

**note**: The `_install` script will create a symlink from the repo `.bash_profile` to `~/.bash_profile`. If you have a pre existing `~/.bash_profile` rename it to `~/.bash_user.sh`.
